Extremely WIP and barely of the description, but it's an improved UWP port of KrasiF's sorting algos, a WPF program.

Note that this is how it looks in dark mode. It'll be on light mode if it's the default mode that you set in your system settings.

Major credit to ArrayV (https://github.com/Gaming32/ArrayV-v4.0) for the shuffles and distributions.

Not working right now. A major overhaul is in progress.
